<h1 align="center">Online Retail Sales Analysis</h1>

## Introduction:
The online retail sector generates massive amounts of data daily, spanning customer transactions, product details, and sales performance. Analyzing this data can uncover actionable insights to enhance business strategies, optimize revenue streams, and improve customer experiences. This project focuses on analyzing online retail sales data to identify trends and patterns.

## Business Task & Objectives:
The goal of this analysis is to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that can drive informed decision-making for online retail businesses. We will be using EXCEL to explore and answer key business questions such as:

- What are the most popular product categories and subcategories? Revenue?
- Which cities generate the highest revenue?
- What trends can be observed in customer demographics and purchasing behaviors?
- How do different store types (e.g., e-Shop, TeleShop) compare in performance?
- What are the top contributing factors to successful sales growth?

The dataset consists of 3 raw tables: Customers, Transactions, and Categories that we have cleaned in EXCEL:

<h1 align="center">Insights</h1>

The analysis of our online retail operation reveals several significant patterns about customer behavior and sales metrics. Our retail platform has successfully engaged 5,508 customers who have completed 20,880 transactions, generating a gross revenue of $54,453,885.07. The business maintains a return rate of 10.79% and shows consistent year-over-year growth from 2011 through 2014, demonstrating the business's overall positive trajectory.
## Multiple Stores
The multi-channel strategy shows varying degrees of effectiveness across our city locations:
- City stores collectively generate $19,824,816.05 (40.7% of total revenue)
- E-Shop contributes $9,715,688.19 (20.0% of total revenue)
- MBR accounts for $9,674,486.08 (19.9% of total revenue)
- Flagship stores bring in $9,364,781.08 (19.3% of total revenue)
City 1 stands out as our highest-performing location with $4,770,496.06 in sales, followed closely by City 10 ($4,863,301.69) and City 2 ($4,858,308.99). This suggests that our urban concentration strategy is effective, particularly in these high-performing metropolitan areas.
## Customer Demographics and Purchasing Behavior
- The age group analysis reveals that the 40-44 demographic represents our most valuable customer segment, followed by the 45-49 age group. This middle-aged consumer base appears to have the highest purchasing power among our customers.
- Gender distribution in sales shows a relatively balanced picture with a slight male spending advantage (M: $24,955,632.51 vs F: $23,623,513.23).
This balanced gender distribution indicates our product mix appeals across genders, though there may be opportunities to strengthen appeal in specific categories.
## Product Performance and Customer Purchasing Patterns
Strong performance in electronics, clothing, and home/kitchen categories. Product basket analysis shows:
- Single-product transactions (4633) generate $3,049,766.49 in revenue.
- As the number of products per transaction increases, so does the total revenue, with 5+ product baskets (4716 transactions) generating $16,495,651.00.
## Recommendations
- Optimize the product mix in underperforming city locations to mirror the success patterns of City 1 and City 10
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns for the 40-49 age demographic while implementing strategies to increase engagement with younger consumer segments
- Enhance cross-selling mechanisms to increase average transaction value, as customers purchasing multiple products generate significantly higher revenue
- Implement seasonal inventory planning to capitalize on observed sales patterns throughout the year
- Investigate opportunities to reduce return rates through improved product descriptions, quality control, or sizing guides
