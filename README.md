# Online Retail Sales Analysis

## Introduction
The online retail sector generates massive amounts of data daily, spanning customer transactions, product details, and sales performance. Analyzing this data can uncover actionable insights to enhance business strategies, optimize revenue streams, and improve customer experiences. This project focuses on analyzing online retail sales data to identify trends and patterns.

## Business Task & Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that can drive informed decision-making for online retail businesses. We will be using EXCEL to explore and answer key business questions such as:

- What are the most popular product categories and subcategories? Revenue?
- Which cities generate the highest revenue?
- What trends can be observed in customer demographics and purchasing behaviors?
- How do different store types (e.g., e-Shop, TeleShop) compare in performance?
- What are the top contributing factors to successful sales growth?

The dataset consists of 3 raw tables: Customers, Transactions, and Categories that we will clean in EXCEL:
